# WASM Outside the Browser

**Adam Crain**
*June 10th, 2025*

# Agenda

- TODO

---

# What's WASM?

---

# Why WASM?

## The JavaScript Performance Wall

- **JavaScript limitations**: Dynamic typing, JIT compilation overhead
- **asm.js (2013)**: Mozilla's attempt at "assembly for the web"
  - Subset of JavaScript optimized for AOT compilation
  - Still parsed as JavaScript - inherently limited
- **Need for true bytecode**: Faster parsing, smaller payloads, predictable performance
- **Cross-language support**: Run C/C++/Rust/Go code in browsers efficiently

---

# WASM History

- **2015**: WebAssembly first announced by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Apple
- **2017**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) shipped in all major browsers
- **2019**: W3C standardization - became official web standard
- **2020+**: WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) enables non-browser environments
